                            Our goal is to train the data provided by the Yelp website - specifically the business data on all existing restaurants in the United States and the reviews written by customers - in order to predict the relationships between business attributes and the
                            business’ overall success, defined by their star rating (0-5). In addition to business feature insights, we perform a sentiment analysis using NLP on the text data provided by customer reviews to help businesses better understand
                            what contributes to customer preferences. Ultimately, we hope to provide a tool for restaurant owners to predict their business’ long-run average star rating and to help in their decision-making processes.

                        <strong>• The Dataset: </strong>
                        <br/>We work with the review json from the Yelp Dataset. This dataset contains the following fields: Business ID, Review ID, Text, User ID, Userful, Cool, Funny, Date, Stars and Type. <br/>
                        <br/>We are specifically working with the ‘text’ and ‘stars’ fields, where ‘stars’ serves as our target output. We split the training dataset into 70% training, 15% hold-out as a way to obtain accuracy prior to generalizing our
                        models. Finally, we test on the remaining 15% of data.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>• Preprocessing: </strong>
                        <br/>In order to preprocess the text reviews, we decided to perform the following: (1) remove white spaces, (2) remove punctuation, (3) remove stop words, and (4) lemmatize words. We also created a new column called ‘sentiment’
                        which converts to star ratings into either a positive, neutral or negative review. Ratings of 1 and 2 map to negative, 3 maps to neutral, and 4 and 5 maps to positive. <br/>
                        <br/>The review data contains 8,021,122 rows of data with the following distribution. We first filtered out (1) closed businesses, (2) kept only restaurant businesses, and (3) filtered on the businessID’s contained in the business
                        dataset. From there our dataset was reduced to 3,487,813 rows and the rating distribution looked like the following:

                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../images/yelp-ds-fig1.png" id="w-node-74a68f1f4cd2-9e3092e3" class="image-7" />
                            <figcaption>Fig 1: Distribution of Stars</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <br/>We see here that there is a skew in our ratings towards positive ratings of 4 and 5 and acknowledge that this can lead to issues when predicting on new reviews because the prediction may be skewed towards ratings that have
                        a higher frequency. In order to work with a manageable amount of data, we conducted most of our modeling on a sample of this dataset by extracting 10,000 rows through random sampling with replacement.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>• Feature Extraction Models: </strong>
                        <br/> For feature extraction of the text, we use two methods. The first model, the Bag of Words Model, is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It is called a “bag” of words, because
                        any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded. The second model, the TF-IDF model, uses a weighting scheme that assigns each term in a document a weight based on its term frequency (tf) and
                        inverse document frequency (idf). The terms with higher weight scores are considered to be more important.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>• Machine Learning Prediction Models: </strong>
                        <br/>For the sentiment analysis prediction models, we decided to train on three different models, namely (1) multinomial naive bayes, (2) logistic regression with class set to ‘multinomial’ to account for the different classes
                        in the case of both individual star predictions and sentiment predictions, and (3) linear SVM. For the linear SVM model, we trained the feature vectors on a variety of regularization hyperparameters to find the best classification
                        F1-scores. We graph the F1-scores for each hyperparameter in the following section. These algorithms ultimately allowed us to apply a diverse set of prediction methods for our classification problem and are tailored for text classification.

                        <br/>We work with the business json from the Yelp Dataset. Out of all the columns, the ‘city’, ‘state’, ‘postal code’, ‘stars’, ‘review_count’, and ‘attributes‘ fields are used. All other features serve as x, while ‘stars’ serve
                        as y - the target. We split the training dataset into 70% training, 15% hold-out, and the remaining 15% test data.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>• Preprocessing: </strong>
                        <br/>In order to preprocess the business data, we took care of the following: (1) missing data, (2) businesses other than restaurants, (3) closed restaurants, and (4) restaurants outside the United States. We also created a new
                        column called ‘binary_star’ that converts ratings into either positive (1) or negative (0). Ratings of 1 and 2 map to negative and 4 and 5 maps to positive.

                        <br/> All potential business features that could impact the average star rating of the respective restaurant have been extracted. Afterwards, categorical features were converted to binary conditional data of (yes, no).
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        <br/>For the business factor analysis prediction models, we decided to train on three different models, namely (1) random forest regression, (2) decision tree regression and (3) linear regression. For regression models, we set
                        the target output to be continuous variables. To measure accuracy, the MSE, MAE, RMSE have been used.

                        We ran the multinomial naive bayes, logistic regression, and linear SVM on BoW and TF-IDF on the training set and predicted on the hold-out set. After running the models, we use the following calculation, known as the F1-score, a geometric mean of precision
                        and recall which represents our ability to predict correct positives, to evaluate our models:

                        <br/>We ran our three different machine learning algorithms but with different inputs and labels for each model. For the first model, we ran the model without text preprocessing and predicted the individual star ratings. For the
                        second model, we ran the model with text preprocessing and again predicted the individual star ratings. For the final model, we used the ‘sentiment’ column with preprocessing since our overall goal was to predict the overarching
                        sentiment from the given text. For the linear SVM of both models, we conducted hyperparameter tuning with varying C values to arrive at the one outputting the highest F1 score, which in this case was at C = 0.1. The following tables
                        show our F1 scores for the different versions we tested:

                        <br/>From the experimental results, we can see that: (1) based on the two different feature extraction models, the Bag of Words model generally performed better than the TF-IDF model. (2) There did not seem to be a significant
                        difference between preprocessing the text and no preprocessing of the text and in some cases, preprocessing led to worse performance. After doing more research, this seems plausible since some stop words convey sentiment and thus
                        removing them will decrease the accuracy of the overall models. (4) We also found that within the BoW runs, the logistic regression with multiclass set to multinomial generated the best accuracy performance at an F1 score of 0.810.
                        (5) Some of the top words that contributed to a high rating were ['amaze' 'delicious' 'excellent' 'awesome' 'exactly']. On the other hand, some of the top words that contributed to a poor rating were ['mediocre' 'rude' 'overprice'
                        'horrible' 'poor']. Thus, we can conclude that there are a number of potential factors at play, such as quality of the food, service, and the overall experience. This information is especially important and salient for restaurant
                        owners because it allows them to gain a better understanding of what factors contribute to a high or low ratings in an easily digestible format. From there, they can adjust their dining options and experience accordingly.

                        <br/>From the experimental results, we can see that: (1) both Random Forest Regression and Decision Tree models have the potential to much improve with grid search. (2) Random Forest Regression works the best with the number of
                        trees in the forest set to be 600, the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node 10, the minimum number of samples required to be a leaf node 2, the number of features to consider when looking for the best split
                        to be square root, and the maximum depth of the tree 60. (3) The best model performance can be achieved with a criterion of using mean squared error with Friedman’s improvement score for potential splits, the max depth of the tree
                        of 6, and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node is 2.

                            In this paper, we explicated multiple machine learning based methods to help business owners expand upon their current suite of resources to better understand their consumer base in terms of both reviews and business attributes. We created two models
                            to achieve this end. The first model, the sentiment analysis model, ran MultinomialNB, logistic regression, and Linear SVM. The second model, the business attributes, ran linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree
                            regression, and random forest regression. Overall, the set of business attributes we tested seem to be reasonable predictors of a restaurant’s average star rating.
